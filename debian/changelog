libtar (1.2.20-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * no_maxpathlen.patch: Half of the part of the patch modifying
    compat/dirname.c was missing, causing libtar's dirname to always
    return NULL (except in special circumstances). Actually make it work
    (Closes: #745352). (The reason that libtar doesn't use libc's
    dirname() and basename() on some or most platforms is that the code
    doesn't work with destructive versions of these functions).

libtar (1.2.20-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * no_maxpathlen.patch: Fix two grave bugs in the patch. First,
    th_get_pathname would only allocate as much memory as was needed for
    the first filename encountered, causing heap corruption when/if
    encountering longer filenames later. Second, two variables were mixed
    up in tar_append_tree(). Also, fix a potential memory leak and trim
    the patch a bit.
  * [SECURITY] CVE-2013-4420.patch: When the prefix field is in use, the
    safer_name_suffix() function should certainly be applied to the
    combination of it and the name field, not just on the name field.
  * th_get_size-unsigned-int.patch: Make the th_get_size() macro cast the
    result from oct_to_int() to unsigned int. This is the right fix for
    bug #725938 on 64-bit systems, where a specially crafted tar file
    would not cause an integer overflow, but a memory allocation of almost
    16 exbibytes, which would certainly fail outright without harm.

libtar (1.2.20-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * no_static_buffers.patch: avoid using a static buffer in
    th_get_pathname(). Taken from upstream. Needed for no_maxpathlen.patch.
  * no_maxpathlen.patch: Fix FTBFS on Hurd by dynamically allocating path
    names (Closes: #657116). Thanks to Svante Signell and Petter
    Reinholdtsen.
  * [SECURITY] CVE-2013-4420.patch: Strip out leading slashes and any
    pathname prefix containing ".." components (Closes: #731860). This is
    done in th_get_pathname() (as well as to symlink targets when
    extracting symlinks), not merely when extracting files, which means
    applications calling that function will not see the stored
    filename. There is no way to disable this behaviour, but it can be
    expected that one will be provided when the issue is solved upstream.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.5.

    overflow (Closes: #725938).

  * New upstream release.

 -- Magnus Holmgren <holmgren@debian.org>  Sun, 05 May 2013 17:59:29 +0200

libtar (1.2.16-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream: Chris Frey has stepped up with the consent of the
    original author, Mark Roth, and published an "official unofficial" git
    repo at http://repo.or.cz/w/libtar.git, which I will use for the time
    being.
  * Updated debian/watch to look for tags and corresponding snapshot
    tarballs at above URL.
  * All patches have been incorporated or (in the case of
    autoreconf.patch) made obsolete upstream.
  * debian/rules: Add build-indep and build-arch targets.
  * Updated debian/copyright.
  * Use dpkg-buildflags to set CFLAGS et al.
  * debian/control: Add VCS fields; bump Standards-Version to 3.9.3.

libtar (1.2.11-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * libtool.patch: Set SHELL to the configured shell in those Makefile.in
    where libtool is used; otherwise libtool fails when /bin/sh is dash
    but bash is expected (Closes: #621935).
  * man_hyphen_minus.patch (new): Escape hyphens that should be minus
    signs in man pages.
  * Rename libtar as libtar0 to follow policy.

libtar (1.2.11-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer (Closes: #526618).
  * Change source format to 3.0 (quilt), clean up Debian diff and split
    into several patches:
    * libtool.patch: Using libtool to build dynamic library;
    * autoreconf.patch: Changes needed to call autoreconf (bug 511741);
    * memleak.patch: Fix memory leaks;
    * bad_ptrtoint.patch: Document stupidity of tartype_t in libtar.c 
      (bug 309945).
  * Increase Debhelper compat level to 7.
  * Use dh_autoreconf to avoid having to keep track of files to clean.
  * memleak2.patch (new): Applied instead of memleak.patch. Fix memory
    leak by making th_get_pathname() return a pointer to a static buffer
    instead of a pointer to a copy of a local buffer (LP: #41804).
  * Add homepage field and watch file (in case there is ever a new
    upstream release).
  * Upgrade to Standards-Version 3.9.1.
